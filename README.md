# Frontend of application `SCOOP As A Service`
## Quick Start
**Developer friendly version to kickoff:**
* if you have installed create-react-app globally, run this command to uninstall it first, `npm uninstall -g create-react-app`, then install it again, `npm install -g create-react-app` so that we could obtain the latest version yet avoid possible conflicts.

* clone the repo to a destination directory 
  > `git clone`
* go to project directory 
  > `cd FrontEnd`
* install node modules
  > `npm install`
* if any errors: 
  > `npm audit fix`
* start your application 
  > `npm start`  

That's it! Your React app is firing up in your browser: http://localhost:3000/
